    "## 1 - Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. As seen below, it merges two images, namely: a **\"content\" image (C) and a \"style\" image (S), to create a \"generated\" image (G**). \n",
    "\n",
    "The generated image G combines the \"content\" of the image C with the \"style\" of image S. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you are going to generate an image of the Louvre museum in Paris (content image C), mixed with a painting by Claude Monet, a leader of the impressionist movement (style image S).\n",

    "Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning. \n",

    "Following the [original NST paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), we will use the VGG network. Specifically, we'll use VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the shallower layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers). \n",
